    <li>2 tablespoons raisins</li>

    <li>In a large pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Wash the basmati rice under cold water and drain it.</li>

    <li>Refrigerate the kheer for a couple of hours before serving.</li>
    <li>Serve chilled and garnish with additional nuts and saffron strands, if desired.</li>
