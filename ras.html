  <h1 >Rasgulla Recipe</h1>
  <img src="rasgulla.jpg" alt="rasgulla">
 
    <li> s1 liter whole milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
    <li>A few strands of saffron (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol >
    <li>In a large pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice. Stir gently until the milk curdles and the whey separates from the curds. This process may take a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Line a sieve or colander with a cheesecloth or muslin cloth. Pour the curdled milk into the cloth to strain out the whey. Rinse the curds under cold water to remove any lemony taste.</li>
    <li>Gently gather the edges of the cloth and squeeze out any excess water from the curds. Hang the cloth with the curds for about 30 minutes to drain any remaining liquid.</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes, remove the curds from the cloth and transfer them to a clean surface. Knead the curds with the heel of your hand until they come together and form a smooth dough-like consistency. This may take about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a smooth, crack-free ball. Ensure there are no cracks, as they can cause the rasgullas to break during cooking.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, combine the sugar, water, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
    <li>Gently slide the rasgulla balls into the boiling sugar syrup. Cover the pot and let them cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>After 15 minutes, remove the pot from the heat and let the rasgullas cool down to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Once cooled, refrigerate the rasgullas for at least 2 hours before serving. They taste best when chilled.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Enjoy the delicious homemade rasgullas!</p>

  <img src="gi.jpg" alt="kheer">
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk, plus extra as needed</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
    <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee for deep frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking powder.</li>
    <li>Add ghee to the bowl and mix well until the mixture resembles bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Gradually add milk and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Add more milk if needed, a little at a time, until the dough is smooth and pliable.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball, ensuring there are no cracks.</li>
    <li>In a deep pan or pot, heat oil or ghee for deep frying over medium heat.</li>
    <li>While the oil/ghee is heating, prepare the sugar syrup. In a separate saucepan, combine sugar and water and bring to a boil. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat and add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the sugar syrup. Simmer for a few minutes until the syrup slightly thickens. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
